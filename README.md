0x11. C - printf

Group project by: Emmanuel Asiedu and Priscilla Yartey.

Task 1:
Write a function `_printf` that produces output according to a format string. It should handle conversion specifiers `%c`, `%s`, and `%%`.

Task 2:
Extend the `_printf` function to handle conversion specifiers `%d` and `%i`, which print signed integers.

Task 3:
Add support for a custom conversion specifier `%b`, which converts an unsigned integer argument to binary.
